Creating sublists with slicing
Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Create a sublist from a list



list slicing
See this repl  for the examples. You have seen list slicing already, as an alternative to using the .copy() method. list slicing provide a range of values within an existing list. The syntax is simple: some_list[low_index:high_index:step_value]. Note that the high_index is NOT included in the sublist.

some_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]

# create a sublist of the third and fourth elements
sublist = some_list[2:4]

print(sublist)



the step_value in a slice

The step_value defaults to 1, and so it is not necessary to include it in many cases. However, if you want every other value of a list, that is easily accomplished.

humans_and_animals = ['Brad Pitt', 'seagull', 'Sammy Davis Jr', 'cat', 'Thurston Moore', 'crane']

humans = humans_and_animals[0:len(humans_and_animals):2]
print(humans)

animals = humans_and_animals[1:len(humans_and_animals):2]
print(animals)

Sublist Function 1
Submitted on Today at 7:44 PM
Write a function called every_third_from_list. This function will take a list as an argument. This function should use slicing to return a new list containing every third element of the passed in list.

For example, given the input list:

some_list = ['ford', 'taurus', '1997', 'chevy', 'malibu', '2003', 'amish', 'buggy', '1857']
you would expect to return

['1997', '2003', '1857']

my answer
# define your function here
def every_third_from_list(some_list):
        some_list = ['ford', 'taurus', '1997', 'chevy', 'malibu', '2003', 'amish', 'buggy', '1857']
        return some_list[2::3]

galvanize answer
def every_third_from_list(lst):
    return lst[2::3]
The third value (3) is the step value that will give every third element.
