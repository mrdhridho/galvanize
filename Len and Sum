Len and Sum
Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Apply the len() function.
Apply the sum() function.



len()and sum()
Two functions that you will be using quite often are len() and sum(). len() will return the length of a list and sum() will add up all the contents of the list, as long as the list only contains numeric types.




Using the len() function



len() returns the number of elements in a list.

General Syntax:
len(<list_name>)
...where:
len() is the function we are calling, and will return the length of the input list.
<list_name> would be replaced by the lists variable name
Run the following code in this repl 

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(len(numbers))

print(len(list(range(10))))



Using the sum() function

The sum function does exactly what it sounds like - it calculates the sum of all the elements of the passed in list. The function works with lists that contain only numeric-typed data.



General Syntax:
sum(<list_name>)
...where:
sum() is the function we are calling, and will return the sum of the numbers within the list.
<list_name> would be replaced by the lists variable name
Run the following code to get a feel for the syntax:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(sum(numbers))
a = 10
n = 20

num_list = list(range(a, n)) # not inclusive of n
print(sum(num_list))

Given the following list, enter its length.

list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]
2
Correct
RESET INPUT
CHECK ANSWER
The list consists of two nested lists. Therefore the length of the list will be 2 because there are two elements in the list that len() is being called on.

Given the following code, what will get printed to the console?

list_to_sum = [112, 115, 276, 431]
print(sum(list_to_sum))
934
Correct
RESET INPUT
CHECK ANSWER
112 + 115 + 276 + 431 = 934

Given this list of daily high temperatures:

daily_temps = [61.2, 59.0, 59.4, 58.9, 60.1, 55.3, 55.6]
Calculate the average high for this week.

Note:

You are trying to calculate the mean of this list.
Use the sum() and len() functions to do this.
Give the exact answer that appears when you calculate the answer in python.
58.50000000000001
Correct
RESET INPUT
CHECK ANSWER
Use sum(daily_temps)/len(daily_temps) to calculate the mean.
