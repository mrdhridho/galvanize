List membership
Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
Determine if an element is part of a list.
Determine if an element is not part of a list.

list Membership
When presented with a list, oftentimes we will need to decide if some element is either part of the list, or else is explicitly not part of the list. There are a few ways to determine this:
----Using in-----
The in keyword can by used to check whether an element is in a list.
element in list
# or
bool_result = element in list
--
...where:

element, an element for which we are searching in the list.
list, a list in which we are searching.
bool_result (optional), a bool value, in which we can save the result of the element in list expression.
==
operating_systems = ['Windows', 'Linux', 'MacOS', 'Android']

# success case
OS_is_present = 'Linux' in operating_systems
print(OS_is_present)

# failure case
OS_is_present = 'FreeBSD' in operating_systems
print(OS_is_present)
==
----Using not in--------
The not in combination works, as you woud imagine, in the exact opposite way that in works; if an element is not in a list then <element> not in <list_name> will return True. Similarly, if an element is in a list, then <element> not in <list_name> will return False.
element not in list
# or
bool_result = element not in list
...where:
element, an element for which we are searching in the list.
list, a list in which we are searching.
bool_result (optional), a bool value, in which we save the result of the element not in list expression
Take a look at some examples below:

recipe_contents = ['Sugar', 'Flour', 'Eggs', 'Butter']

# success case (meaning element is NOT in list)
ingredient_not_present = 'Chocolate Chips' not in recipe_contents
print(ingredient_not_present)

# failure case (meaning element IS in list)
ingredient_not_present = 'Eggs' not in recipe_contents
print(ingredient_not_present)
=====
Using `in`
If you had a list whose defintion was your_list = list(range(10)) + list(range(50, 65, 5)), what would the expression 65 in your_list return?
--
your_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 50, 55, 60] and since 65 is not in that list, the answer is False.
=====
What would be the result of the following expression:

first_list = list(range(-100, 1, 10))
second_list = list(range(0, 101, 10))
joined_lists = first_list + second_list + [11]

11 in joined_lists
--
Since [11] was used to create joined_list, it would be in the final list.
