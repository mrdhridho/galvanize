There are three basic logical operators:

not
not True evaluates to False
not False evaluates to True
and
True and True evaluates to True
True and False evaluates to False
False and True evaluates to False
or
True or True evaluates to True
True or False evaluates to True
False or True evaluates to True
False or False evaluates to False
These logical operators are used to create compound conditions. Regarding order of evaluation, not precedes and, which precedes or. It is always recommended that you use parentheses to keep your logic clear by using parentheses.
