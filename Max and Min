Max and Min



Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

Apply the max() function.
Apply the min() function.



max() and min()

Two functions that are also frequently used are max() and min(). max() finds the maximum value in a list and min() finds the minimum value in a list.

Using max()
General Syntax:
max(<input_list>)
...where:

max() is the function we are calling, and will return the maximum value in <input_list>.

<input_list> is a list we are passing to our function call. It will not be affected by the function call.

Run the following code in this repl 

numbers = [1, 3, 4, 6, 2]
max_num = max(numbers)

print(max_num)
a = 30
n = 90

num_list = list(range(a, n))
print('max:', max(num_list))
Using min()
General Syntax:
min(<input_list>)
...where:

min() is the function we are calling, and will return the minimum value in <input_list>.

<input_list> is a list we are passing to our function call. It will not be affected by the function call.

Run the following examples to understand how min() works.

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 6, 2]
min_num = min(numbers)

print(min_num)
a = 30
n = 90

num_list = list(range(a, n))
print('min: ', min(num_list))
multiple_min = [-1, 7, 3, 6, -1, 9, 10, -1]
print(min(multiple_min))
