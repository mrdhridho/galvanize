=>else
 else will execute if no other conditions are met
 else block appears not to have a condition
 In other words, the word "else" can be read to mean "under all other conditions".
=>elif
 elif is short for "else-if".
 start with if, and else acts as an end
 elif and else are not required for valid code.
Common mistakes
This else is not preceded by an if or an elif so it is invalid

# the above chain of conditions is finished

# the code below will throw an error because it is not preceded by an `if`
elif num == 12:
