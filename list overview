A list is a collection of arbitrary objects, somewhat akin to an array in many other programming languages, but more flexible than most. The contents of a list are ordered, mutable, accessible by index, can be nested to arbitrary depth, and are dynamic. In Python, lists are the primary construct on which you will perform iteration, or going item-by-item across a data structure. lists, along with tuples, are versatile data types found in almost any code that you will write.
Describe, in your own words, why it might be helpful to create an ordered collection of data when writing a program?
